Find images of species and antibodies in a specific tissue (mostly HPA) 
It is required to find the images that satisfy the following clauses: 
Organism ="Homo sapiens" and Antibody ="CAB034889" and (Organism Part = "Prostate" OR Organism Part Identifier = "T-77100") # noqa
To send the query to the searchengine, the user should create
two filter groups, i.e. "and" filters and "or" filters;
And filters:
It has two clauses:
Organism ="Homo sapiens", i.e. name ="Organism", value="Homo sapiens", and operator ="equals" # noqa
this can be translated to a dict {"name" : "Organism", "value":"Homo sapiens", "operator" :"equals"} # noqa
each clause should have the same format so the second clause should be:
{"name" : "Antibody Identifier", "value":"CAB034889", "operator" :"equals"}
The and_filters list should contain the two clauses:
"""

    {"key": "Organism", "value": "Homo sapiens", "operator": "equals"},
    {"key": "Antibody Identifier", "value": "CAB034889", "operator": "equals"},

The same should be done for "or" filters as they are also a list and
have clauses in the same format as "and" filters.
